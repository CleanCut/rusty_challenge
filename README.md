# Rusty Challenge!

So, you want to learn Rust, eh?  See if you can survive these challenges!  Mwuhahahaha!

# Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. For each directory in `dungeon/` (Starting with `level00` after which comes `level01` which is followed by `level02` and proceeds in a likewise manner.  I'm sure you see, because if you don't you've already lost, which would not only be terribly sad due to sheer incompetence but would also preclude you from ever wielding the powerful magic that is Rust.)
  1. Open `src/main.rs` and delve into the challenge at the top of the file.
  2. Survive the challenge.  Nay, conquer the challenge!  MAKE IT DANCE TO YOUR WISHES!
  3. Feel your rustical power increasing steadily.
3. Having passed all the challenges, glory in the power of Rust that you
   have obtained, and go forth and conquer the world!
