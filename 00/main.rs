//! Well, you found me.  I guess we better get started.
//!
//! CHALLENGE NUMBER ZERO!
//! This crate isn't even a crate.  "WHAT!", you say? That is correct. A main.rs
//! alone does not a crate make. Soooo, you'll have to fix it.
//!
//! Find a "cargo" command that you can run from 00/ that will add the necessary missing file(s) 
//! to the **existing directory** so that when you do "cargo run", the message below gets printed
//! to your console.  Run that command!  Run it, I say! FIX THE CRATE!!!

fn main() {
    println!("It feels swell to have a config file.");
}
